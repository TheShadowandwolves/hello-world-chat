# hello-world-chat
Hi, 
This is an application I build on css and html. The purpose of it is to make it available for any person to connect or share new or existing contacts together.
Thus, using only a qr-code, nfc or any other methods, the user/person should be able to send to the other person his contact information. 
The user should be able to set their profile with any social media, private or global information on to one "easy to read" business card. 
The user has fully control which information he wants to share to any person that receives his contact invite, or is finding him via the application. 
There will be 5 option given: 
1. private (only him, or with given excemptions),
2. friends & family (only for close friends/family, set by him),
3. contacts (any contacts, excluding given excemptions),
4. public via app (any user of the app can find him and see given public information)
5. public via global (anyone can find, search and contact him with the information set for public via global).

The system will work from private to public via global. Any information or user set on a higher scala (nearest to private) will not be read, shared to a user outside his field (if no excemption were given). 
Thus, any information or user shown as a lower scala (nearest to public via global) can be seen, found, shared to a user inside his field (if no excemption were given). 
As an example: An information set for contacts only, may be seen by his contacts, friends & family and himself. However, this information will not be share or seen by the public.

Information, as given above or later, means any phone number, private or business email, address. Any given url to any social media plattform etc.
The user itself is permitted to decide with information he wants to share and on which status. 
This application is only for sharing contacts but may, in the future, have their own chat, post and story option available.

This is a private project. Therefore, it might take a while. If you considered to constribute on this project, you may do so. Please only be legit and understandable.
You may contact me via instagram: @theShadowandWolves for any questions, request etc.
